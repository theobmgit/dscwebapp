# Simple CRUD with MERN

This app runs locally.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```shell
cd server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

2. Contact me to get the `.env` file and put it in `server/` folder

3. Run

```shell
node -r dotenv/config app
```

This will initialized `dotenv` at runtime instead of requiring it inside `app.js`, since Node.js does not support `require()`
